## About
The project idea is based on a Yoga studio in Stockholm, the website should have a modern simplistic flow containing 
five main pages. The idea of the website is to attract all individuals looking to get into yoga and meditation
from any background and skill level emphasizing the ease for beginners to join in and be apart of the studio, with a main focus on strength classes and flexibility classes with various mediation classes following on in the day.
The site should have a very easy flow and navigation feel with a more minimalist set up making user experience refined and simple to navigate where they wish to go.
# 

The website is aimed at all age groups and skill levels as there will be various classes and for each individual skill level.
With a focus on attracting New individuals who would like to try yoga or meditation for the first time.
There will be an in-depth story into the team and how the studio came to be so you feel welcomed from the minute you read to the minute that you book through the site.

see the attached Hybrid Mock-ups for the website here ---> 
I took it one step further than a basic wireframe when designing the site as it was my first website and thus created the hybrid mockups as seen below

## Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes. It is beginner-friendly and very easy to use. To better demonstrate the differences, I sort my wireframes by page and show the versions for mobile, tablet and desktop next to each other.

### Differences in deployed version:
 * Created fresh Navbar to cover top segment of all pages
 * decreased Page selectors down from 4 to 3 to create more space on the page
 * adjusted animation and font-styling in accordance to the design and flow of the website.

## Design

    consistant for aesthetic viewing. I did this through https://coolors.co/

 ### Font and styling
    I went with google fonts as my primary choice of font picking and used the font realtions tool to pick the optimal fonts for my project varying with style from headings to text
    I ended up with 3 main fonts. These where Handlee, Montseratt and railway Which all paired well through the styling phase of the project

## Testing
### functionality Testing
 #### Navigation Bar
 * Plan Make the site easy to navigate by providing a navbar and using easily 
  understandable names for the pages.
* Make the Navbar fixed so its always accessible at all times around the site for easier navigation
* Implementation I used the Bootstrap navbar and added several Bootstrap flexbox classes to position it on the right side for all devices, except mobiles.
  On mobile devices I also used Bootstrap to make the navbar collapse and be displayed within the
  hamburger icon for a more accessible responsive feel.
* Test
 I tested all links on all pages to make sure that the correct site is displayed.
* Result
Each page was fully accessible across the project
* Everything seems to be working as intended

#### Page selectors
* plan was to make 3 Accesible page selectors on the home page so people can read and go to the locations
they wuish to go on every page.
* I genereated circular divs with circular anchor tags as buttons to take people to each page
* tested moving to each page and back without any trouble
* It seems to be working as intended

#### Footer
* Created various Navigation and social links around the website and to various other websites to create further User experience and intergration with the company
* added a list to the various pages and implemented side by side accessible icons for the different social pages all linked.
* Tested each of these links and they worked well across all pages
* Everything seems to be working as intended

#### Info Section
* Created a seperate marketing section on various pages to get people involved and encourage them to book through the website
or get in touch about questions they may have
* created accessible links for the contacts and booking page with large headings to provide information and directions
* Tested these across the necessary pages and worked well
* Everything is working as intended

#### Contact form
* provided an accessible and easy way for customers to contact and be in touch about various questions throught he use of a form
* implemented a form from bootstrap and changed various titles and classes to better suite the project
* Tried to submit without entering any data and it stopped the submission with the necessary requirements
* Result 
  When clicking 'Submit' without filling out any or all fields or when entering invalid data the user is asked to enter the missing data or to correct his/her input.
  Thus the form needs to be completed correctly before submission. Which was intended

#### Booking form
* Provided an eccessible  and encouraging way to book with ease through the use of a booking form highlighting skill level,
date and time available for the course or class you wish to take.
* Tested the form by trying to submit without data and with data* form worked as intended and would not submit without the required data and would if it was filled in.

#### Google map
* designed to be visually intuitive and provide better understanding of address and direction
* works as intended as its easily accessible not to large and can be expanded if necessary
