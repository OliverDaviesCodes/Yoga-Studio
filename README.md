# Zen Studio

## About
The project idea is based on a Yoga studio in Stockholm, the website should have a modern simplistic flow containing 
five main pages. The idea of the website is to attract all individuals looking to get into yoga and meditation
from any background and skill level emphasizing the ease for beginners to join in and be apart of the studio, with a main focus on strength classes and flexibility classes with various mediation classes following on in the day.
The site should have a very easy flow and navigation feel with a more minimalist set up making user experience refined and simple to navigate where they wish to go.
# 

The website is aimed at all age groups and skill levels as there will be various classes and for each individual skill level.
With a focus on attracting New individuals who would like to try yoga or meditation for the first time.
There will be an in-depth story into the team and how the studio came to be so you feel welcomed from the minute you read to the minute that you book through the site.

see the attached Hybrid Mock-ups for the website here ---> 
I took it one step further than a basic wireframe when designing the site as it was my first website and thus created the hybrid mockups as seen below

## Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes. It is beginner-friendly and very easy to use. To better demonstrate the differences, I sort my wireframes by page and show the versions for mobile, tablet and desktop next to each other.

### Differences in deployed version:
 * Created fresh Navbar to cover top segment of all pages
 * decreased Page selectors down from 4 to 3 to create more space on the page
 * adjusted animation and font-styling in accordance to the design and flow of the website.

  * This is created for ease of navigation continously around the site. The navbar will also be fixed so that it can be accessed from any point on a page
    for easier user experience

## Design
  
  ### Colours
    I used a very cool colour palette across my entire project keeping things
    consistant for aesthetic viewing. I did this through https://coolors.co/

 ### Font and styling
    I went with google fonts as my primary choice of font picking and used the font realtions tool to pick the optimal fonts for my project varying with style from headings to text
    I ended up with 3 main fonts. These where Handlee, Montseratt and railway Which all paired well through the styling phase of the project
