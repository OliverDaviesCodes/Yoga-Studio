# Zen Studio

## About
The project idea is based on a Yoga studio in Stockholm, the website should have a modern simplistic flow containing 
five main pages. The idea of the website is to attract all individuals looking to get into yoga and meditation
from any background and skill level emphasizing the ease for beginners to join in and be apart of the studio, with a main focus on strength classes and flexibility classes with various mediation classes following on in the day.
The site should have a very easy flow and navigation feel with a more minimalist set up making user experience refined and simple to navigate where they wish to go.
# 

The website is aimed at all age groups and skill levels as there will be various classes and for each individual skill level.
With a focus on attracting New individuals who would like to try yoga or meditation for the first time.
There will be an in-depth story into the team and how the studio came to be so you feel welcomed from the minute you read to the minute that you book through the site.

see the attached Hybrid Mock-ups for the website here ---> 
I took it one step further than a basic wireframe when designing the site as it was my first website and thus created the hybrid mockups as seen below
